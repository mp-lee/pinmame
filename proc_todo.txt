* P-ROC not PROC
* "-proc" switch to generally enable P-ROC support
* YAML file support ./p-roc folder (configurable via ini file)
* #ifdef P-ROC_SUPPORT correctly
* changed #define's go to a variable (so they can be set differently when "-proc" switch is set)
* move all of the P-ROC specific functions to p-roc/*.
  So it should be possible to remove the PRHandle from coreGlobals.
  Then we could get rid of library's pinproc.h in core.h.
