* makefile & src/p-roc/p-roc.mak:
  - Either P-ROC provides a MinGW package or all external pre-compiled stuff
    goes to ./p-roc (subfolder gcc for library)
  - CPPFLAGS += -std=gnu99?
  - Correct LDFLAGS and LIBS definition in p-roc.mak?
  - Find all CFLAGS changes and see if these should be added to CPPFLAGS too.

* "P-ROC" not "PROC"
* "-proc" switch to generally enable P-ROC support
* YAML file support ./p-roc folder (configurable via ini file)
* #ifdef P-ROC_SUPPORT correctly
* changed #define's go to a variable (so they can be set differently when "-proc" switch is set)
* move all of the P-ROC specific functions to p-roc/*.
  So it should be possible to remove the PRHandle from coreGlobals.
  Then we could get rid of library's pinproc.h in core.h.

  FYI - Looks like it should be safe to removed references to coreGlobals.proc.
  coreGlobals.p_rocEn should be used instead (and is used in most places).  Then
  pinproc.h can be removed from core.h.
